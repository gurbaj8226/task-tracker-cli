#Task Tracker (Java CLI)

A clean, testable CLI for tracking tasks, with **file-based persistence**, built to practice enterprise-style Java fundamentals.

- Serve as a base for later features (JDBC/Spring Boot)

##Features
- Add, list, complete, delete tasks
- Persist to disk (CSV/plain text)
- Input validation and basic error handling
- Simple search/filler (planned)

##Tech Stack
